# Server

Ansible playbook making your server practically maintain itself üõ†

Features:

- [unattended package upgrades][unattended-upgrades] ‚Äì relax, we got
  your security patches ‚õ±
- one-command OS distribution upgrades - 14.04 ‚Üí 16.04 ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ üèó
- [Jupyter notebook][jupyter] (optional) ‚Äì analyse all the things üìà


## Usage

Install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/). An easy way if you have Python locally:

    pip install ansible

Prepare your *hosts* file by adding your servers
and prepare the *config.yml* file where you can optionally
change the global defaults:

    cp hosts.example hosts
    cp config.yml.example config.yml

Make sure:

 - you can ssh into the added servers using only your ssh
   public key (no password) first. You can push your public key to the server using:
   
        ssh-copy-id user@host
       
 - the user you ssh as to the servers is on the sudoers list
 - you satisfy other Ansible managed node requirements, which is basically Python 2.
   On recent Ubuntu VMs on Digital Ocean, you might have to install it:
   
        apt-get install python-minimal

There are additional settings in *group_vars/servers* which can be overriden.

Test that you can access the servers:

    ansible -m ping all

**Finally to run the playbooks execute:**

    ansible-playbook server.yml


## Components

There are a number of playbook components that are not deployed or run
by default.

### Distribution upgrades

Since upgrading your OS distribution task can take quite some time, it is
available as a separate playbook that you run as:

    ansible-playbook upgrade.yml

### Jupyter notebook

To install the optional [Jupyter notebook][jupyter] either enable it in
*group_vars/servers* or create an individual server's config file in
*host_vars/server-alias* ( matching a server alias from your hosts file).
Example config:

    ---
    install_notebook: True

    notebook_password: sha1:67c9e60bb8b6:9ffede0825894254b2e042ea597d771089e11aed
